# Electra

## What is Electra?
Electra is a blockchain using the highly-secure and power efficient NIST5 algorithm. Combining temporary Proof-of-Work with high Proof-of-Stake, the Electra coin (ECA) is unique in its distribution. On June 16, 2017, Electra entered "Super Rewards Bonanza" stage for 24 hours (Blocks 11522-11810). During this time, 95% of the proof-of-work coins were mined. At block 11811, Electra swapped to Proof-of-Stake with an annual interest rate of 50% until the Electra supply reaches 30bil. Once 30bil ECA is reached, block rewards will be earned through transaction fees only. This created a gold-rush period, promoting the network (or was hoped to) and rapidly increasing the amount of ECA.

## Why NIST5?
Electra chose to use NIST5 as its hashing algorithm because it has been proven to be more secure and power efficient than other leading algorithms. NIST5 is a combination of the finalists and winner of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology Hash Function Competition(specifically BLAKE, Gr√∏stl, JH, Keccak/SHA-3, and Skein. NIST5 was created fairly recently, and immediately saw use by other coins, but failed to see mainstream adoption.
